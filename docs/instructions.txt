== Addressing modes

=== Register Direct Addressing
Data Register Direct		<ea> = Dn
Address Register Direct		<ea> = An

=== Absolute Data Addressing
Absolute Short				<ea> = (Next Word)
Absolute Long				<ea> = (Next Two Words)

=== Program Counter Relative Addressing
Relative with Offset			<ea> = (PC) + d16
Relative with Index and Offse	<ea> = (PC) + d8

=== Register Indirect Addressing
Register Indirect						<ea> = (An)
Postincrement Register Indirect			<ea> = (An), An ¯ An + N
Predecrement Register Indirect			An ¯ An–N, <ea> = (An)
Register Indirect with Offset			<ea> = (An) + d16
Indexed Register Indirect with Offset	<ea> = (An) + (Xn) + d8

=== Immediate Data Addressing
Immediate					DATA = Next Word(s)
Quick Immediate				Inherent Data

=== Implied Addressing
Implied Register			<ea> = SR, USP, SSP, PC, VBR,SFC, DFC
